# How to contribute

We appreciate contributions.  All of the
[main Polymer project][polymer-contributing] guidelines for
contributors also apply to this project

## Vulnerabilities, Bugs, & Pull Requests

Please do not file security-related bugs on the issue tracker.  Instead
use [Google's security vulnerability disclosure form](https://goog.gl/vulnz).
Please see [bug notes] for details.

We use our Github [issue tracker] for tracking feature requests and
non-security-related bugs.

If you have a patch, please use our Github [PR queue].  Don't be suprised if
your first PR gets a visit from the [CLA bot].
